# Benchmarks

Different languages benchmarked in different benchmarks.  
For more details view the benchmarks in the directories.

Feel free to add more languages and benchmarks.
But always use the same algorithms in all languages, so for example don't just use a better prime finding algorithm in one language since the comparison wouldn't make sense then. You can of course restructure the code and use shortcuts the languages has if it makes it faster, but the general idea of the algorithm used has to be the same.

And no matter what happens, remember one thing: *js fast*
